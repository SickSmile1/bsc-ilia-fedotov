abstract = {We introduce a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for atomistic simulations of liquid and amorphous elemental carbon. Based on a machine-learning representation of the density-functional theory (DFT) potential-energy surface, such interatomic potentials enable materials simulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at much lower computational cost. We first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can achieve in carbon structures; then, using a novel hierarchical set of two-, three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with state-of-the-art empirical potentials. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of "diamond-like" tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) are presented, including an estimate of the amorphous material's surface energy, and simulations of high-temperature surface reconstructions ("graphitization"). The new interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.},

abstract = {We present a new semi-empirical potential suitable for molecular dynamics simulations of liquid and amorphous Cu-Zr alloys. To provide input data for developing the potential, new experimental measurements of the structure factors for amorphous Cu64.5Zr35.5 alloy were performed. In this work, we propose a new method to include diffraction data in the potential development procedure, which also includes fitting to first-principles and liquid density and enthalpy of mixing data. To refine the new potential, we used first-principles and liquid enthalpy of mixing data published earlier combined with the densities of liquid Cu64.5Zr35.5 measured over a range of temperatures. We show that the potential predicts a liquid-to-glass transition temperature that agrees reasonably well with experimental data. Finally, we compare the new potential with two previously developed semi-empirical potentials for CuâZr alloys and examine their comparative and contrasting descriptions of structure and properties for Cu64.5Zr35.5 liquids and glasses.},

abstract = {Typical empirical bond-order potentials are short ranged and give ductile instead of brittle behavior for materials such as crystalline silicon or diamond. Screening functions can be used to increase the range of these potentials. We outline a general procedure to combine screening functions with bond-order potentials that does not require to refit any of the potential's properties. We use this approach to modify Tersoff's [Phys. Rev. B 39, 5566 (1989)], Erhart {\&} Albe's [Phys. Rev. B 71, 35211 (2005)] and Kumagai et al.'s [Comp. Mater. Sci. 39, 457 (2007)] Si, C and Si-C potentials. The resulting potential formulations correctly reproduce brittle materials response, and give an improved description of amorphous phases.},
